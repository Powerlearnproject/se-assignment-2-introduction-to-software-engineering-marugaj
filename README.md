Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
ANS : This is a branch within computer science that deals with the development, testing and maintenance of software. It involves application of programming knowledge to build software. Ensures reliablility and efficiency of developed software. It differes from the traditional programming in a number of ways. Traditional programming involves coding without a clear picture whereas software engineering involves structure and organisation. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
ANS: The SDLC cycle involves a number of phases that are preceded by the planning stage where gathering of requirements and documentation of user and system needs.
a. Design-Creation of designs for the architecture and interfaces.
b. Implementation- Where code to build the software is written and  according to specified designs
c. Testing- This is where various tests are performed in order to ensure the software meets the set standards and goals.
d. Maintenance- This involves ongoing support for the software in terms of updates or enhancements after the software is deployed.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANS: The waterfall methodology involves a linear progression from the beginning to the end of a project. It seeks to identify and mitigate identified risks at the initial project stages.This is prefered in scenarios where the project is short and simple, all the requirements are fixed and clear and the resources are adequately trained and available.
The agile methodology seeks to prioritize cross functional collaborarion and continous improvement. It breaks the project into phases and teams follow a cycle of planning, executing and evaluating. Ideal scenarios inlude while starting with new projects, in projects with shorter turnaround times or tight deadlines and in projects that require frequent and consistent updates.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
ANS: Requirements engineering is a process involving identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. 
The process involves the below
a Feasibility study that involves consideration of the technical, operational, and economic feasibility.
b Requirements elicitation that includes the ways used to gain knowledge about the project domain and requirements.
c Requirements specification that is an activity used to produce formal software requirement models
d Requirements verification and validation which ensures software correctly implements specified functions as well as ensuring software built is traceable to customer requirements.
e Requirements Management which includes the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders.

It guarantees the effective creation of a software product as it entails tasks that help understand, record and manage the demands of the involved stakeholders.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
ANS: This is aimed at the creation of software in a way that will minimize the dependency among the components of a system. The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but they can perform complete functions when not connected with each other. It improves maintainability and scalability by helping to localize the impact of changes, simplifies maintenance as systems can function individualy, and enhances the understandability of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
ANS: a Unit testing is the smallest testable part of the software system. It is commonly performed in the early develpment process by the engineers themselves. This is important as it ensures code is developed correctly.
b Intergration testing is conducted to verify whether combined units work well together as a group. This is important as it is aimed at detecting the flaws in the combination of units within a module.
c Systems testing invloves testing of a complete software system. It serves to verify the product's compliance with the functional and technical requirements and overall quality standards.
d Acceptance testing is where the product is validated against the end user requirements. It is the last stahe and ensures customer expectations are met. It is important as it helps the team decide whether the product is ready for deployment.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
ANS: Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are therefore the software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. The systems help teams track each individual change by each contributor and to prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Examples include 
a Git with a distributed network architecture, merge conflict resolution, active development status and inclusive of bitbucket support.
b SVN with a client server network architecture, merge or lock conflict resolution, active development status and no bitbucket support.
c Mercurial with a distributed network architecture, merge conflict resolution, active development status and inclusive of bitbucket support.
d CVS with a client server network architecture, merge conflict resolution, maintenance only development status and no bitbucket support.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
ANS: This is the person who takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and supports the succesful completion of the projects.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
ANS: This is the process of modifying, changing, and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve erros, improve performance, or adapt to a changing environment.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
